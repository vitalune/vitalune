## About Me

I won't pretend I have tons of hobbies, I'm single-minded about AI- When I'm not engineering, I'm thinking about engineering. Lunch and dinner are usually my breaks from work, and I spend them watching podcasts of the frontier AI CEOs. I'm constantly thinking of ways to out-step the rest of the AI world, and I think I'm close.
