# Hi, I'm Amir Valizadeh 👋

**I'm an 18-year-old incoming freshman at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science.** Passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, I’m building a strong foundation with courses and hands-on projects before diving into advanced topics like deep learning regression and neural networks. My goal is to not only contribute- but become a leader in the worldwide availability of AI technologies, and the further redefinition of what "*artificial intelligence*" truly means.
